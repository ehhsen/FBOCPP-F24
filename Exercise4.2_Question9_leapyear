are leap years. For example, because 1600 is evenly divisible by 400, 1600 was a leap year.
Similarly, because 1988 is evenly divisible by 4 but not by 100, it was also a leap year. Using
this information, write a C++ program that accepts the year as user input, determines whether
the year is a leap year, and displays a message telling the user whether the entered year is or
is not a leap year.*/

/*b. How many runs should you make for the program written in Exercise 11a to verify that itâ€™s
operating correctly? What data should you input in each program run?

Answer:
at least two program runs are required to check if our code is running correctly.
In one run we put s as input and in other we put any other character that displays that our res
