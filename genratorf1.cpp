//Question2:
//An electrical manufacturer tests five generators by measuring their output voltages
//at three different times. Write a C++ program that uses a nested loop to enter
//each generatorâ€™s test results, and then computes and displays the average voltage for 
//each generator. Assume the following generator test results:
//             Testresult1    Testresult2	Testresult3
//1st generator:   122.5 		122.7 		 123.0
//2nd generator:   120.2 		127.0 		 125.1
//3rd generator:   121.7 		124.9  		126.0
//4th generator:   122.9 		123.8  		126.7
//5th generator:   121.5 		124.7  		122.6
//
//Also calculate and display the average voltage for all the generators.
